Cannot say that Curzon’s daughter loves him. Should think it probable. Curzon pulled his ears last Tuesday week.’</p><p>‘How!’ cried the captain, starting.</p><p>‘For looking at his daughter, please you,’ said the novice.</p><p>‘Write Curzon down, Denounced,’ said the captain. ‘Put a black cross against the name of Curzon.’</p><p>‘So please you,’ said the novice, ‘that’s not the worst—he calls his ‘prentice idle dog, and stops his beer unless he works to his liking. He gives Dutch cheese, too, eating Cheshire, sir, himself; and Sundays out, are only once a month.’</p><p>‘This,’ said Mr Tappert gravely, ‘is a flagrant case. Put two black crosses to the name of Curzon.’</p></div> </div>
