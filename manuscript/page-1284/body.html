It was then I dressed him in my clothes, and dragged him down the back-stairs to the piece of water. Do I remember listening to the bubbles that came rising up when I had rolled him in? Do I remember wiping the water from my face, and because the body splashed it there, in its descent, feeling as if it MUST be blood?</p><p>‘Did I go home when I had done? And oh, my God! how long it took to do! Did I stand before my wife, and tell her?
