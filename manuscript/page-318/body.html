Your niece has plighted her faith to me, and I have plighted mine to her. What have I done that you should hold me in this light esteem, and give me these discourteous words?’</p><p>‘You have done that, sir,’ answered Mr Haredale, ‘which must be undone. You have tied a lover’s-knot here which must be cut asunder. Take good heed of what I say. Must. I cancel the bond between ye. I reject you, and all of your kith and kin—all the false, hollow, heartless stock.’</p><p>‘High words, sir,’ said Edward, scornfully.</p><p>‘Words of purpose and meaning, as you will find,’ replied the other. ‘Lay them to heart.’</p></div> </div>
